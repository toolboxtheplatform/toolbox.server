[![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20to%20build%20a%20Node.js%20server%20that%20scales&url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/writing-scalable-architecture-for-node-js-2b58e0523d7f)

Note: This is a sample project for my blog on medium which can be found [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/writing-scalable-architecture-for-node-js-2b58e0523d7f).

## Get Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` inside its root folder.
3. run `nodemon index.js` (assuming `nodemon` npm package is already installed in your systems)

## Client side for this project
To test this project using browser I implemented the client side of this project which is in react and redux. The blog for that could be found [here](https://medium.com/@zafarsaleem/login-using-react-redux-redux-saga-86b26c8180e)

### Real world project
I developed a complete real world project using this architecture which can be found [here](https://github.com/zafar-saleem/timeoff-server). Please go ahead a explore it and leave feedback if you can.
